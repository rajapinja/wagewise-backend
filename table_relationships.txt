This interpretation assumes certain relationships based on the common fields present in the tables. The relationship types (such as one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many) could be established by defining foreign keys in the respective tables based on the primary keys of related tables. For instance, foreign keys like project_id, customer_id, builder_id, etc., can be added to establish these relationships formally.
